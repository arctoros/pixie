# pixie

This is an 8-bit computer I designed and built in the game/simulator Turing Complete.  

I programmed pixie to play Snake, and to simulate Conway's Game of Life.
In order to do that, I also built an accompanying display unit.  

I've included the game files for Turing Complete and the verilog export files for anyone wanting to dig deeper.
Finally, the excel file contains the architecture of pixie.
